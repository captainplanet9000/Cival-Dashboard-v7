# üêç Railway Python Backend Deployment

Since Railway has Python environment management restrictions, here's how to deploy the backend as a separate service:

## Option 1: Deploy Frontend Only (Recommended for Now)
The current Railway deployment is configured to deploy just the Next.js frontend with mock data. This allows you to:
- ‚úÖ See the complete dashboard interface
- ‚úÖ Navigate all pages and components
- ‚úÖ Test the memory analytics dashboard
- ‚úÖ Verify the trading interface
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend will use mock data until Python service is added

## Option 2: Add Python Backend as Separate Railway Service

### Step 1: Create requirements.txt for Backend Only
```bash
# In python-ai-services directory
cat > requirements.txt << EOF
fastapi>=0.104.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0
pydantic>=2.5.0
letta>=0.4.0
redis>=5.0.0
aioredis>=2.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
sqlalchemy>=2.0.0
asyncpg>=0.29.0
openai>=1.3.0
anthropic>=0.7.0
structlog>=23.2.0
EOF
```

### Step 2: Create Python Service railway.toml
```toml
# In python-ai-services/railway.toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python main_consolidated.py"

[env]
PORT = "8000"
PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11"
```

### Step 3: Deploy Python Service
```bash
cd python-ai-services
railway init python-backend
railway up
```

### Step 4: Connect Frontend to Backend
Update the frontend environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-python-backend.railway.app
```

## Option 3: Use External Python Hosting

Deploy the Python backend to:
- **Render**: Free Python hosting
- **Heroku**: Python dyno support
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Python apps
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless Python functions

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Frontend Deployed**: Dashboard with mock data  
‚è≥ **Backend**: Deploy as separate service or external host  
üîß **Memory System**: Ready for backend connection  

The memory analytics dashboard is fully functional in the frontend and will automatically connect to the Python backend once deployed!
